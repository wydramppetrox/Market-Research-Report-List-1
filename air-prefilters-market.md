<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Air Prefilters Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Grid or Screen</li><li>Spongy Looking</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Air prefilters are essential in HVAC systems, designed to capture larger particulate matter before it reaches finer filters. The market can be categorized into two main types: grid or screen prefilters and spongy-looking prefilters. Grid or screen prefilters feature a flat, rigid design that allows for airflow while trapping dust and debris. In contrast, spongy-looking prefilters are made from porous materials, offering greater surface area for capturing particles. Both types enhance air quality and prolong the lifespan of primary filters.</p></p>
