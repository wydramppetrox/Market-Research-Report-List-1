<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Cranial Orthose Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Active Helmets</li><li>Passive Helmets</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The cranial orthosis market is primarily divided into two types: active helmets and passive helmets. Active helmets are designed to exert controlled forces to shape the skull actively, often incorporating adjustable components. In contrast, passive helmets rely on a more static approach, allowing natural growth and development to reshape the skull over time without continuous adjustment. Both types aim to correct cranial deformities in infants and young children, ensuring proper head shape and alignment for overall health.</p></p>

<p><strong>The Cranial Orthose Market Industry Research by Application is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Plagiocephaly</li><li>Scaphocephaly</li><li>Other</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The cranial orthosis market is primarily driven by conditions like plagiocephaly, scaphocephaly, and other head shape deformities. Plagiocephaly, characterized by asymmetrical head shape, necessitates corrective helmets to realign skull growth. Scaphocephaly, or elongated head shape, requires similar intervention to ensure proportional development. Additionally, other cranial deformities are treated using custom orthotic devices, promoting optimal cranial growth and enhancing aesthetics. This market focuses on developing innovative solutions to address these conditions effectively, improving patient outcomes and quality of life.</p></p>
