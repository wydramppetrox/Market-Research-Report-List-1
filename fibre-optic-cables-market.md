<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Fibre Optic Cables Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Single-mode Optical Cable</li><li>Multimode Optical Cable</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Fibre optic cables are categorized into two primary types: single-mode and multimode. Single-mode optical cables, characterized by a small core diameter, transmit light directly down the fiber and are ideal for long-distance communication due to lower signal loss. In contrast, multimode optical cables have a larger core, allowing multiple light modes to propagate simultaneously; they are better suited for shorter distances, such as within buildings or local networks. Both types play crucial roles in modern high-speed data transmission.</p></p>
