<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Sponge Management Systems Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Radio-Frequency Identification</li><li>Bar Codes-Count</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Sponge Management Systems utilize various technologies for tracking and inventory management, primarily focusing on two types: Radio-Frequency Identification (RFID) and Bar Codes. RFID employs electromagnetic fields to automatically identify objects, allowing for real-time tracking without direct line-of-sight. In contrast, Bar Codes require a scanner to read printed patterns on products, facilitating easier stock control but requiring manual input. Both systems enhance operational efficiency, streamline inventory processes, and provide accurate data for better decision-making in inventory management.</p></p>
